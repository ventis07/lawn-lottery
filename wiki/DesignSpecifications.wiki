#Design specifications for Alliance Gnome of the Month lottery.

=Alliance level lottery=

*OUTLINE*


Members of the alliance will send isk to one individual to buy tickets. 

Tickets are worth 5 million.

Currently no cap on the amount of tickets one individual can purchase.





=Specifications=

First of every month the lottery starts.

Ticket purchase closes the 25th of every month.

The program pings the API every 30 min to see the balance of the holding toon.

It then checks to see if any new additions to the wallet.

If new adds, checks to see who sent the isk and how much isk was sent.

ticket sales are recorded in MSQL.







=Random notes=
Toon to Toon donations are not taxed.
